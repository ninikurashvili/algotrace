# AlgoTrace — Session Progress

## What was built

### 1. TypeScript interfaces (`src/algorithms/types.ts`)
Defined all shared types: `GraphNode`, `GraphEdge`, `Graph`, `GraphSnapshot`, `AlgorithmStep`, `AlgorithmFn`.
Added `NodeState` and `EdgeState` union types that the canvas maps directly to colors.
Also updated `SPEC.md` to include the full interface block (it was missing `Graph`, `GraphSnapshot`, and `AlgorithmFn`).

### 2. Folder structure (`src/`)
Created all directories and placeholder files per the spec's build order:
`algorithms/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `context/`, `data/`, `utils/`

### 3. BFS (`src/algorithms/bfs.ts`)
Pure function — takes `Graph` + `startNodeId`, returns `AlgorithmStep[]`.
- Marks nodes as `'start'` → `'current'` → `'visited'` as the algorithm runs
- Tracks a `treeEdges` set so traversal edges stay green (`'accepted'`) across all future steps
- Per-step `edgeOverrides` layer lets the active edge flash orange for one step, then settle to green
- Georgian messages for every step: enqueue, dequeue, skip already-visited

### 4. DFS (`src/algorithms/dfs.ts`)
Same pattern as BFS but uses a Stack (LIFO).
- Marks visited **on pop**, not on push — stack can hold duplicates
- Pushes neighbors in reverse order so first neighbor processes first (left-to-right DFS)
- Already-visited neighbors are checked at **push time** and not added to the stack, preventing duplicate "already visited" messages on undirected graphs
- Same `treeEdges` green-edge persistence as BFS

### 5. GraphCanvas (`src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`)
SVG renderer — no external library.
- Nodes: `circle r=24` with label text, colored by `NodeState`
- Edges: `line` with optional `markerEnd` arrowhead for directed graphs (4 colored SVG marker variants)
- Edge weights float above the midpoint of each line
- **All colors use inline `style` props**, not SVG presentation attributes — Tailwind's preflight overrides presentation attributes via the `*` selector, which was causing colors to not appear

### 6. `usePlayback` hook (`src/hooks/useInterval.ts`)
Manages step-by-step playback of a pre-computed `AlgorithmStep[]`.
- State in `useReducer` (index, isPlaying, speed) — avoids multiple `setState` calls in effects
- Timer refs (`indexRef`, `speedRef`, `stepsLenRef`) avoid stale closures inside `setInterval`
- `play()` / `pause()` / `stepForward()` / `stepBack()` / `reset()` / `setSpeed()`
- Auto-pauses at last step
- Resets automatically when the `steps` array reference changes (new algorithm run)

### 7. App.tsx wiring
Connected BFS → `usePlayback` → `GraphCanvas` with Play/Pause/Forward/Back buttons.
Canvas reads `currentStep.graphState.nodeStates` and `edgeStates` directly.

## Bugs fixed along the way

| Bug | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| DFS double "already visited" message on undirected graphs | Already-visited neighbors were pushed to stack and triggered a second skip message at pop time | Gate the push: only push unvisited neighbors; emit skip message at push time without pushing |
| Node/edge colors not showing | Tailwind preflight sets `fill: currentColor` on SVG elements via `*`, overriding SVG presentation attributes | Switch all dynamic colors to inline `style` props |
| Traversal edges not staying green | `edgeSnapshot()` rebuilt from blank every step, losing history | Added `treeEdges` Set; snapshot merges blank → accepted → per-step active override |

---

### 8. `GraphBuilder.tsx` (`src/components/GraphBuilder.tsx`)
Left-panel UI component for building graphs before running an algorithm.
- Three mode buttons: **Select**, **Add Edge**, **Delete** — active mode highlighted in blue
- **Add Node** button — places a new node on the canvas using a golden-angle spiral layout so nodes don't stack on top of each other; labels auto-increment A, B, C…
- **Edge weight input** — visible only in Add Edge mode; accepts any number; attached to the next edge created
- Status hint text — "Click first node…" / "Click second node…" guides the user through the two-click edge creation flow
- **Delete Selected** button — appears only when a node or edge is selected in Select mode; removes the node and all its connected edges
- **Directed toggle** — switch that toggles arrow rendering on the canvas in real time
- **Reset Graph** — clears all nodes and edges
- **Edge weight editor** — when an edge is selected in Select mode, a number input appears pre-filled with its current weight; editing it updates the weight in real time without needing to delete and re-add the edge. Clearing the field removes the weight entirely (`weight: undefined`)
- Node count display at the bottom

### 9. `GraphCanvas.tsx` interaction layer (`src/components/GraphCanvas.tsx`)
Extended the existing pure SVG renderer with optional interaction props (all optional — existing algorithm-only usage is unchanged):
- `onNodeClick(nodeId)` — fires on click but NOT after a drag (tracked via a `hasDragged` ref)
- `onEdgeClick(edgeId)` — 14px-wide invisible hit overlay on each edge so thin lines are easy to click
- `onNodeDrag(nodeId, x, y)` — SVG-coordinate-aware drag (converts screen px → SVG units via `getBoundingClientRect`); drag tracked at SVG level so fast mouse movement never loses the node
- `selectedNodeId` — renders a dashed orange ring around the highlighted node (used for both selected node in Select mode and the pending source node in Add Edge mode)
- `selectedEdgeId` — renders the edge in blue at 3px stroke width
- `userSelect: none` + `e.preventDefault()` on mousedown prevent text selection during drag

### 10. `BFSDashboard.tsx` graph-state wiring (`src/pages/BFSDashboard.tsx`)
Rewrote the dashboard to own all graph and builder state:
- **Build phase** (`isBuilding = true`): shows GraphBuilder left panel + interactive canvas; graph editing fully enabled
- **Run phase** (`isBuilding = false`): hides builder, locks canvas read-only, shows playback controls and DataPanel
- Node click handler dispatches to the correct action based on active mode (select / addEdge / delete)
- Edge click handler: select toggles `selectedEdgeId`; delete removes it immediately
- Node drag updates the node's `x/y` in graph state on every mouse-move event
- "Run BFS" uses `selectedNodeId` as the start node (falls back to `graph.nodes[0]`) — so the student can pick a start by clicking a node before pressing Run
- "← Edit Graph" returns to build phase and resets playback to step 0
- Helper `nextLabel` generates A–Z then AA, AB… labels; `nextPosition` places nodes on a golden-angle spiral within canvas bounds (60–740 x, 60–540 y)

---

## Bugs fixed along the way (continued)

| Bug | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Click fires after drag ends | `onClick` fires after every `mouseup` regardless of movement | Track `hasDragged` ref; node click handler early-returns if true |
| Drag loses node when mouse moves fast | `onMouseMove` was on the circle, not the SVG | Moved drag handlers to SVG-level `onMouseMove` / `onMouseUp` / `onMouseLeave` |
| BFS neighbors message shows duplicate labels (e.g. "B, C, C, D") | `getNeighbors` returns one entry per edge — two edges A→C produce two C entries | Deduplicate labels with `[...new Set(...)]` before joining |
| Directed toggle thumb slides outside pill | No `left` anchor on the thumb + no `overflow-hidden` on button | Added `left-0` and `overflow-hidden` to contain the thumb within the pill |
| Queue chips escape DataPanel border during animation | Framer Motion uses `position: absolute` for `popLayout` exits; `overflow: hidden` only clips abs-positioned children when the parent is a containing block | Added `position: relative` to the chip container so `overflow: hidden` clamps the slide-out animation |

---

### 11. `DataPanel.tsx` animation (`src/components/DataPanel.tsx`)
Replaced static node chips with Framer Motion animations:
- **Queue row** — `AnimatePresence mode="popLayout"` + `layout` on each chip: new entries slide in from the right (`x: 36 → 0`), dequeued entries slide out to the left (`x: 0 → -36`); remaining chips shift smoothly via layout animation. Direction hint "Front → Back" shown below the header.
- **Discovered / Processed rows** — chips pop in with a spring scale animation (`scale: 0 → 1`) when a node is first added; no exit animation since nodes are never removed from these sets.
- **Current node** — crossfades with `mode="wait"` so the old chip fades out before the new one fades in.
- `DS_TITLE` and `DS_DIRECTION` maps make the panel label-agnostic: passing `algorithmLabel="DFS"` will show "Stack / Top → Bottom", `"Dijkstra"` shows "Priority Queue / Min → Max", ready for future dashboards.

---

### 12. `dfs.ts` — full rewrite with call-stack approach (`src/algorithms/dfs.ts`)
Replaced the simple push-all-neighbors stack approach with an **iterator-based call stack**:
- Each frame in the call stack tracks `{ nodeId, nextIdx }` — which node we're at and which neighbor to process next
- Explores one neighbor at a time going **all the way down** before moving to the next sibling — matches recursive DFS exactly
- Stack display (`dataStructure`) shows the **current path** only (e.g. `[A, B, D]`), not pending siblings — C never appears while exploring B's subtree
- Node colors convey the call stack: `current` (orange) = active leaf, `queued` (blue) = ancestor in path waiting, `visited` (green) = fully explored subtree
- Backtrack step generated when a node exhausts all neighbors — shows which node we return to
- Default graph changed to A→(B,C), B→(D,F), C→(G,H) to clearly demonstrate depth-first traversal: A→B→D→F (backtrack)→C→G→H
- Deduplicated neighbor labels in messages with `[...new Set(...)]`

### 13. `DFSDashboard.tsx` (`src/pages/DFSDashboard.tsx`)
New page mirroring BFSDashboard with DFS-specific changes:
- Imports `dfs` instead of `bfs`; passes `algorithmLabel="DFS"` to DataPanel → Stack panel shows "Stack / Top → Bottom" with the correct animation
- Play button and Run button use purple (`bg-purple-600`) to visually distinguish DFS from BFS (blue)
- Speed slider accent also purple (`accent-purple-500`)
- `showWeights={false}` — weights hidden in builder since DFS ignores them
- Wired into `App.tsx` routing and `HomePage.tsx` (`available: true` for DFS card)

---

### 14. `dijkstra.ts` (`src/algorithms/dijkstra.ts`)
Pure function returning `AlgorithmStep[]` with full Dijkstra implementation:
- Priority Queue as a sorted `[distance, nodeId][]` array — re-sorted on every insert; correct for small graphs
- `dist[]` table initialised to `Infinity` for all nodes except start (`dist[start]=0`)
- Stale-entry detection: if a popped node is already in `visited`, skip it with a message (handles duplicate PQ entries from relaxation)
- Edge relaxation: for each neighbor, if `dist[u]+w < dist[v]` → update `dist[v]`, push new entry to PQ, mark edge green
- No-update step: when existing distance is already better, shows a step with the comparison (`dist[v]=X already better`) so students see why the edge is skipped
- `distanceTable` snapshot included in every step so DataPanel can show live distances
- Node colors: `start` (blue init), `current` (orange = being settled), `queued` (blue = in PQ), `visited` (green = settled)
- `dataStructure` shows PQ node labels in priority order (min distance = leftmost chip)

### 15. `DataPanel.tsx` — distance table section
Added a `dist[ ]` section that renders only when `step?.distanceTable` is defined (Dijkstra only, BFS/DFS unaffected):
- Each graph node gets a row showing `label | distance`
- Settled nodes (visited): green background + green distance value
- Reached but not settled: amber background + amber value  
- Unreached: dark background + gray `∞`
- Rows use `motion.div` with `layout` for smooth reordering as distances update

### 16. `DijkstraDashboard.tsx` (`src/pages/DijkstraDashboard.tsx`)
New page with amber color theme (`bg-amber-600`, `accent-amber-500`) to distinguish from BFS (blue) and DFS (purple):
- `showWeights={true}` — weight input shown in builder since Dijkstra requires weights; defaults missing weights to `1`
- Default graph: A→B:4, A→C:2, B→D:5, C→D:1, D→E:3 — demonstrates that A→C→D (cost 3) beats A→B→D (cost 9)
- Wired into `App.tsx` routing and `HomePage.tsx` (`available: true` for Dijkstra card)

---

### 17. `kruskal.ts` (`src/algorithms/kruskal.ts`)
Kruskal's MST with path-compressed Union-Find:
- Sorts all edges by weight ascending, processes them in order
- Union-Find with path compression + union by rank — O(α(n)) per operation
- Each edge generates two steps: "considering" (orange flash) then "accept ✓" or "reject ✗"
- Accepted edges become green and stay green; rejected edges become red and stay red (only algorithm in the app that uses red permanently — spec explicitly requires it for cycle detection)
- Node states: `unvisited` → `visited` (green) when a node first joins the MST
- Stops early when `n-1` edges are accepted (MST complete, no need to process remaining edges)
- `startNodeId` ignored — Kruskal operates on all edges, not from a single source

### 18. `MSTDashboard.tsx` (`src/pages/MSTDashboard.tsx`)
New page with emerald green theme (`bg-emerald-600`, `accent-emerald-500`):
- `showWeights={true}`, `showStartNode={false}` — MST requires weights but has no start node concept
- Default graph: 5 nodes, 6 edges (A-B:4, A-C:2, B-C:1, B-D:5, C-D:3, D-E:2) — MST accepts B-C:1, A-C:2, D-E:2, C-D:3 (total 8); rejects A-B:4 and B-D:5 as cycles
- `directed: false` default — Kruskal requires undirected graph
- Wired into `App.tsx` and `HomePage.tsx` (`available: true` for MST card — all four algorithms now active)

### 19. `DataPanel.tsx` — MST edge list + GraphBuilder `showStartNode`
- Added MST-specific edge list section: sorted edges shown as rows with live color coding (orange = considering, green ✓ = accepted, red ✗ = rejected, gray = pending). Running MST weight shown below.
- Queue, Discovered, Processed sections hidden when `algorithmLabel === 'MST'`
- Added `showStartNode?: boolean` prop to `GraphBuilder` (default `true`); MST passes `false` to hide the irrelevant start node dropdown

---

### 20. Preset graphs (`src/data/presets.ts`)
Four sets of ready-made graphs, one per algorithm:
- **BFS_PRESETS**: Binary Tree, Star, Cyclic (with a cross-edge), 50-node grid
- **DFS_PRESETS**: Cycle (back edge demo), Deep path (linear chain)
- **DIJKSTRA_PRESETS**: Multiple relaxations (dist[B] updated twice), Detour (A→B direct:10 vs A→D→C→B:6)
- **MST_PRESETS**: K4 complete graph (3 accepted / 3 rejected), Grid (5-node weighted grid)
- Each preset button renders in the `GraphBuilder` sidebar; clicking it loads the graph and resets all selection state
- Dijkstra and DFS presets also reset `startNodeId` to the preset's first node

### 21. 50-node stress-test graph (`src/data/presets.ts`)
`generate50NodeGrid()` creates a 10×5 grid of 50 labeled nodes (A–X, AA–AX):
- Nodes placed at `x = 50 + col*70`, `y = 70 + row*110` — fits the 800×600 SVG viewBox
- 45 horizontal edges + 40 vertical edges = 85 edges total, all unweighted, undirected
- Node labels generated by `nodeLabel(i)`: single letter for 0–25, double letter (AA, AB…) for 26+
- Added to `BFS_PRESETS` as **"50 ნოდი (grid)"** — tests BFS performance and level-order visualization on a large graph

### 22. UI polish — layout, canvas size, message placement
- Canvas column: `flex-1 min-w-[400px] max-w-[720px]` — grows to fill space but caps at 720px so it never fills the full screen on large monitors
- Right panel: `min-w-[256px] max-w-[360px] shrink-0` — grows with content but capped to avoid overflow
- Algorithm message (`currentStep?.message`) moved to directly **below the canvas** in the canvas column, always visible regardless of panel state
- **GraphBuilder moved to the right side** — during Edit mode the builder panel appears on the right, canvas stays on the left; switching between Edit and Run no longer shifts the canvas position
